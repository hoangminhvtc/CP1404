By: Dam Hoang Minh


1. How long did the entire assignment 1 project take you?
> 2 weeks


2. What do you plan to do  differently in your development process for assignment 2?
> I plan to getting an earlier head start on reading the assignment before actually doing it as I felt like I rushed into trying to understanding assignment 1 immediately . That was the reason why i struggled so much.
